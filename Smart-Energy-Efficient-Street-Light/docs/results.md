## Results and Observations

The system was tested under various simulated conditions in Tinkercad.

- During daytime, the street light remained OFF, confirming correct day–night detection.
- At night with no vehicle presence, the street light operated in DIM mode, reducing power consumption.
- When motion was detected, the street light immediately switched to full brightness.
- The active distance sensor successfully detected stationary vehicles, preventing the light from turning OFF.
- The LCD accurately displayed system modes and sensor status.

These results confirm that the proposed system effectively improves energy efficiency while maintaining road safety.
