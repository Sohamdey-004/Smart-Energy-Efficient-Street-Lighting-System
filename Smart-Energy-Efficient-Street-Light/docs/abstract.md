## Abstract

Street lighting systems consume a significant amount of electrical energy due to continuous operation during nighttime. 
This project presents a Smart Energy-Efficient Street Lighting System that dynamically controls light intensity based on ambient light conditions and vehicle presence.

An LDR is used for day–night detection, while a PIR sensor detects motion. 
To overcome the limitation of passive sensors, an active distance sensor is implemented to ensure that the street light remains ON even when a vehicle is stationary.

The system operates in three modes: OFF during daytime, DIM during low activity at night, and FULL brightness when motion or vehicle presence is detected.
The complete system is simulated using Tinkercad and demonstrates significant potential for energy conservation in smart city applications.
